# Process Safe Queue

This create an library for process safe queue. This queue can be used across multiple process inside a single system while
solving the second reader writers problem.

## Usage

### Default compilation

```
make all
```

It also makes a binary called `test` that contains very basic usage of the code.
```
./test
```

### Install it on your system

- Install it using:
    ```
    sudo make install
    ```
- Library name is: safequeue
- Include file name  is: safe_queue.h
- If you want to use it in any of your code do `#include <safe_queue.h>` and compile it using:
    ```
    gcc test.c -lsafequeue -pthread
    ```
    Here test.c is the name of your.

## Testing

See Docs and edit test.c accordingly. Do make all. Execute ./test

## Error handled:
 - Underflow
 - Overflow
 - Re-creation of queue instead of sync
